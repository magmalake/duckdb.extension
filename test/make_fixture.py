"""Write a small Iceberg table with PyIceberg, for the extension to read.

Generated rather than checked in. Iceberg metadata records absolute paths — in
`location`, in `metadata-log` and inside the Avro manifests — so a checked-in
fixture only resolves on the machine that made it.

It is also written by PyIceberg on purpose, so the extension is tested against
a table produced by the reference implementation. A fixture we wrote and then
read back would prove our writer and our reader agree and nothing more.

Deterministic: same rows, same order, every run.

    python test/make_fixture.py test/fixtures    # prints the table directory
